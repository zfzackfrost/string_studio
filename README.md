# String Studio
Random string generator for faster and consistant naming when writing content.

## Rationale
As a hobby, I enjoy programming video games based in fantasy worlds. However, I am not very skilled at
inventing names for all of the characters, and places, et cetera that those settings involve. Thus,
the idea for *String Studio*. Instead of pulling names from thin air, I can enter a pattern and it
will produce several random strings that satisfy the requirements. I then, have a starting place 
to gain some inspiration.
